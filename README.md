# Conversation-SMS-based-AI-Chatbot
Create a conversational SMS-based solution for our lending company, with messages sent through OpenPhone. The chatbot should automatically follow up with clients when they’ve missed parts of a form or need assistance providing documents like statements. It must integrate with OpenPhone’s API and our existing systems to prompt clients, gather necessary information, and ensure all details are complete, helping streamline our onboarding and information-gathering process.
------------
Creating an AI chatbot for a conversational SMS-based solution involves several components, including integration with OpenPhone's API, handling user interactions, and managing the flow of information. Below is a simplified Python script that outlines the core functionalities for this chatbot. You'll need to adapt it based on your specific use case and environment.
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

bash

pip install Flask requests

Step 2: Create the Chatbot Backend

Here's a basic implementation using Flask for the API and the OpenPhone API for SMS messaging:
2.1 Flask Application Structure

python

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Replace with your OpenPhone API key
OPENPHONE_API_KEY = 'your_openphone_api_key'
OPENPHONE_API_URL = 'https://api.openphone.co/v1/messages'

@app.route('/sms-webhook', methods=['POST'])
def sms_webhook():
    data = request.json
    # Extract necessary information from the incoming message
    sender_number = data['from']
    message_text = data['text']

    # Process the message and determine the next step
    response_message = process_message(sender_number, message_text)

    # Send a response back to the client
    send_sms(sender_number, response_message)
    return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200

def process_message(sender, message):
    # Simple logic to check if the message indicates missing information
    if "missing" in message.lower():
        return "It seems you missed some information. Please provide the required documents."
    elif "help" in message.lower():
        return "How can I assist you further? Please specify what you need help with."
    else:
        return "Thank you for your message! How can I help you today?"

def send_sms(to, message):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {OPENPHONE_API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    payload = {
        'to': to,
        'text': message
    }
    response = requests.post(OPENPHONE_API_URL, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)

Explanation of the Code

    Flask Application: This application listens for incoming SMS messages on the /sms-webhook endpoint.
    Webhook Handling: When an SMS is received, it processes the message to determine the appropriate response.
    Message Processing: The process_message function includes simple logic to identify if the message indicates missing information or requests help.
    Sending SMS: The send_sms function sends a reply using OpenPhone's API.

Step 3: Setting Up OpenPhone

    Create OpenPhone Account: If you haven’t already, sign up for an OpenPhone account and get your API key.
    Webhook Configuration: Configure your OpenPhone account to send incoming SMS messages to your Flask application's webhook URL (e.g., http://your-server.com/sms-webhook).

Step 4: Testing the Bot

You can test the bot locally using tools like Postman or by sending a test SMS to your OpenPhone number. Ensure your Flask server is running and that OpenPhone can reach your webhook.
Final Notes

    Enhancements: This is a basic example. You might want to expand the processing logic to include more sophisticated NLP capabilities using libraries like spaCy or integrating with an AI model for more intelligent responses.
    Error Handling: Implement error handling for API requests to OpenPhone and other potential issues in the application.
    Deployment: Consider deploying your Flask application using a cloud service like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud to make it accessible over the internet.

This framework should get you started on building your SMS-based AI chatbot for your lending company.
